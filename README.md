# Tailoring member content with segments

This repo contains the code from my [blog post](https://kjac.dev/posts/using-umb_ucontext-with-umbraco-14-plus/) about using segments to tailor content for member groups.

Please check the blog post for a details.

Note that the Umbraco site is built on [Umbraco V16-RC4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Cms/16.0.0-rc4).

The Umbraco site should just run, because the DB is bundled up in this repo. The admin login for Umbraco is:

- Username: admin@localhost
- Password: SuperSecret123

Member logins for testing the segmentation are hardcoded into the `/login` page ðŸ˜„
